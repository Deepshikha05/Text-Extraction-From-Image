Dear Jim,

Your note expressing sympathy on behalf of my colleagues and friends at
CTR was on my desk when | returned from Britain. Thank you. | had hoped
to fly back from Bristol to New York to catch at least part of the meeting.
In the event, the local situation proved to be overwhelming; my mother of
ninety three needed a lot of help. | am sorry to have let you down but it
was unavoidable.

Now, back in Winnipeg | take up the loose strings. | have completed the
form for the Mexico meeting. With luck we will stay on for a few extra
days but the room rates at the Ritz are too Ritzy for my post retirement
budget. We shall look elsewhere. Joyce send warm greetings to you and to
Gail and we look forward with pleasure to seeing you in February.

Sincerely

Detymmond H. Bowden ~~ â€”>
