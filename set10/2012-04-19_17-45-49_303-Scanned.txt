Dear Charlic,

Since returning to London, my colleague Jackie Pontin and I have given more
thought to how best to capitalize upon the studies on high and low familial risk of
lung cancer which are just being set up with Henry Lynch. Since Dr. Lynch will be
taking the trouble of mounting the field studies in various types of “high” and “low”
risk cancer pedigrees, I feel strongly that we should not miss the opportunity of
establishing immortal cell lines on each of the 400 subjects which we will study.
Such is my conviction that I believe these studies should be started immediately and
not constrained by my move to Newcastle. Here is my proposal:

Omaha will be recruiting 400 subjects, each phenotyped with debrisoquine in vivo :
they will fall into four groups of equal size; sporadic lung cancers with no other
cancer family history ("low” risk), sporadic lung cancers with positive cancer family
history, colon cancer-prone families with high and low family histories, These
latter two types of pedigree are very interesting from the following point of view,
that of the 2000 members of the 10 kindreds, there is only one known case of lung
cancer. Immortalized EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B-cell lines will provide a
future resource for studying the molecular genetics of lung cancer risk. We are
already looking in cohorts with cDNA probes and RPLP analysis for various P450
polymorphisms which we believe may bear upon lung cancer risk. At relatively
small additional cost (supplemented by CTR?) Dr. Lynch could mail us small batches
of fresh blood for B-cell transformation. I cannot see how this should add more
than about $5 to the cost of cach sample collection, or $2000 in toto, but he nceds to
be asked. At our cnd we shall need Ms. Pontin’s salary with on-costs, ($45,000 for
18 months) together with consumable costs for cell transformation, culture and
eryopreservation of $75 per cell line (cf. $500 NIH contracted - out cost!), ie.
$30,000. In addition, we would need to purchase a liquid nitrogen Dewar for
storing the cell lines ($1600). The total cost of the project for the first year would
thus be $51,600 (2/3 $45,000 + 2/3 $30,000 + $1,600).
