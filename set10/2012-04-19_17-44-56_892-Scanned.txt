Dear Charlic,

Since returning to London, my colleague Jackie Poatin and i have given more

thought to how best to capitalize upon the studies on high and bow familia! risk
lung cancer which are just being set up with Heary Lyack Since Dr. Lynch will be
taking the trouble of mounting the field studies in various types of “high” and “low

risk cancer pedigrees. 1 feel strongly that we should not miss the opportunity
establishing immortal cel! lines on cach of the 400 subjects which we » Th
Such is my conviction that I believe these studies should be started imarcciately an 4
not constrained by my mowe to Neweastic. Here is my propose

 

Omaha will be recruiting 400 subjects, cach phenotyped with dedrisoguins in
they will fall into four groups of equal size, sporadic lung cancers with no
cancer family history (low” risk), sporadic lung cancers with positive cancer f
history, colon cancer-prone families with high and low family histories.
latter two types of pedigree are very interesting from the following point of view
that of the 2000 members of the 10 kindreds, there is only ong known case of lung
cancer. Immortalized EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B-cel! lines will prowide a
future resource for studying the molecular genetics of tung cancer risk. We are
aircady looking in cohorts with cDNA probes and RPLP analysis for warious P450
polymorphisms which we believe may bear upon lung cancer risk At relatively
small additional! cost (suppiemented by CTR?) Dr. Lynch could mail us small batches
of fresh blood for B-cell transformation. I cannot see how this showld add more
than about $5 to the cost of cach sample collection, or $2000 in toro, but he needs to
be asked. At our cnd we shall need Ms. Pontin's salary with on-costs. ($45,000 for
18 months) together with consumable costs for cell transformation, culture and
cryopreservation of $75 per cell line (cf. $500 NIH contracted - out cost!), ie
$30,000. In addition, we would need to purchase a liquid nitrogen Dewar for
storing the cell lincs ($1600). The total! cost of the project for the first year would
thus be $51,600 (2/3 $45,000 + 2/3 $30,000 + $1,600)
